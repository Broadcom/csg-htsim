This experiment runs a permutation traffic matrix on varying sizes of
3-tier FatTree from 432 nodes up to 16000 nodes.  It varies the number
of ECMP paths used, and runs each four times with different random
seeds for the random permutation taking the mean FCT from each
configuration.

You'll need bash, python3 and gnuplot.

To run:
./run.sh

Temp files will be placed in the "data" subdirectory.  The may be
large - the graph only depends on the data/fct* graphs, so you can
delete any others.
