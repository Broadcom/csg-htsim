This experiment runs a permutation traffic matrix on varying sizes of
3-tier FatTree from 432 nodes up to 16000 nodes.  It varies the number
of ECMP paths used, and runs each four times with different random
seeds for the random permutation taking the mean FCT from each
configuration.

You'll need bash, python3 and gnuplot.

To run:
./run.sh

Temp files will be placed in the "data" subdirectory.  The may be
large - the graph only depends on the data/fct* graphs, so you can
delete any others.

The script generates a graph in comparison.pdf.
The expected output is in comparison.original.pdf

As the script runs a lot of simulations, some of them for ralatively
large topologies, it will take some time to complete.  If you have a
machine with a lot of RAM and cores, it would be better to run these
in parallel, but the current script is sequential.
