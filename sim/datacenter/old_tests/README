The files in this directory are old simulation scenarios from previous
work.  Some of them are referenced from the EXAMPLES directory.  We no
longer build them by default, but we'd like to keep them working if
possible.  To compile them just run make in this directory, after
running make in the root directory to compile the dependencies.

You can still create standalone simulation binaries the way they are
done in this directory, and add them here if you wish.  However, for
most purposes it is better to use a parameterized main file such as
main_ndp.cpp and then import declarative topologies from
datacenter/connection_matrices for each simulation run.  This involves
a lot less effort to keep things working when APIs change.
