# Basic Tests

This directory contains simple dumb tests developed to check that
basic protocol behaviour is correct.  These are not unit tests, but
full-up simulations, just usually with simple unrealistic topologies.

At some point it might make sense to turn these into validation tests
to avoid code regressions.

If you're developing a new protocol, please add simple tests here.
